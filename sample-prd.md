# PRD Ingestion Feature

## Problem Statement

Currently, \_tencoder lacks the ability to ingest Project Requirements Documents (PRDs) in a structured way. Users need to be able to upload markdown files with YAML front-matter containing project metadata, have them parsed and validated, and store both the raw content and structured data for use by the planning system.

## Solution Overview

Implement a comprehensive PRD ingestion system that:

1. **Accepts markdown file uploads** via a web interface
2. **Parses YAML front-matter** to extract structured metadata
3. **Validates metadata** against our PRD schema
4. **Stores both raw and parsed content** in the database
5. **Provides clear feedback** on validation results

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Components

- **Markdown Upload Endpoint**: `/api/projects/:projectId/prds/upload`
  - Accept POST requests with multipart/form-data
  - Support .md and .markdown file extensions
  - Limit file size to 5MB maximum
  - Return structured validation results

- **YAML Front-matter Parser**
  - Use gray-matter library for robust parsing
  - Extract metadata from document front-matter
  - Validate against PRDMetadata schema using Zod
  - Handle parsing errors gracefully

- **Content Validation**
  - Minimum content length requirements
  - Optional checks for common PRD sections
  - Title extraction from markdown headers

### Frontend Components

- **Upload Form**
  - File picker with drag-and-drop support
  - Progress indicators during upload
  - Validation error display
  - Success confirmation with parsed data preview

- **PRD Display View**
  - Render markdown content with proper formatting
  - Display parsed metadata in structured format
  - Show validation warnings if any
  - Version management interface

## Data Model

The existing PRD model supports our requirements:

```sql
model PRD {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  projectId   String
  title       String
  content     String   // Raw markdown content
  metadata    String   // JSON serialized PRDMetadata
  version     String   @default("1.0.0")
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## Success Criteria

1. **File Upload Works**: Users can upload .md files through the web interface
2. **YAML Parsing Accurate**: Front-matter is correctly extracted and validated
3. **Error Handling Robust**: Clear error messages for invalid files or metadata
4. **Data Storage Complete**: Both raw markdown and parsed metadata are persisted
5. **UI Intuitive**: Upload process is straightforward with good feedback

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: YAML parsing functions, validation logic
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with various file types
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete upload workflow through the UI
4. **Error Case Testing**: Invalid YAML, missing metadata, oversized files

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Backend implementation (upload endpoint, parsing utilities)
- **Day 2**: Frontend implementation (upload form, display views)
- **Day 3**: Testing, refinement, and documentation

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Complex YAML structures causing parsing failures
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting

- **Risk**: Large file uploads impacting performance
  - **Mitigation**: File size limits and progress indicators

- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in file upload
  - **Mitigation**: File type validation and content sanitization
